## Test drive a notes app


Test drive a notes app with the following interactions:

<p>User can add a note with a title and a body<br>
User can see a list of all note titles.<br>
User can pick a note and see its title and body.<br></p>

<p>The user typing code in IRB as an interface is fine for this.</p>
